If this text is public, it means I've successfully rebooted my previously-rebooted blog. Specifically, it means this post has been generated from Markdown written using TextMate on a Mac, has had its HTML generated by an updated version of [Octopress] running with Ruby and rbenv on a Mac instead of Windows (based on a manually-added Git remote I used to merge the latest Octopress source with what I had from two years ago), and is being deployed on Heroku using a new Heroku app with the Cedar stack.

Cool.
