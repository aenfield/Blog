I had a blog in 2003 and 2004. I started it because I happened upon a blog engine written using ASP.NET (<http://dasblog.codeplex.com>), and I thought it'd be cool to see how the engine worked under the covers. I posted occasionally at <http://enfieldfamily.com>. The most popular post was, I think, a "here's how you fix" something entry - I can't remember for what - that came up first or second in searches. When I changed jobs toward the end of 2004 I started doing work that wasn't going to generate posts, and the blog went dead.

Now, eight years later, I've [read about another blog engine][PeterProvostOctopress] that looks interesting, in part because the guts are visible (<http://octopress.org>). My job is also now such that I may have things worth writing down. So I'll try it again.

Some possible upcoming posts: credit where credit's due for Octopress, which is pretty cool; info from the trenches about MSBuild, TFS, and ClickOnce projects.
